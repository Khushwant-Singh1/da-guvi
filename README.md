# Iris Data Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing the classic Iris dataset. It includes modules for data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, statistical summary, pattern analysis, outlier detection, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load data from local files, Kaggle, or URLs.
- **Data Integrity**: Assess and clean data for missing values, duplicates, and biological plausibility.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create biologically meaningful features and scale them for analysis.
- **Summary Statistics**: Generate detailed statistical summaries and domain-specific insights.
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify patterns, correlations, anomalies, and feature importance.
- **Outlier Handling**: Detect and handle outliers using robust statistical methods.
- **Visualization**: Visualize distributions, correlations, PCA projections, and key findings.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Example pipeline for running the full analysis.
- `data_loader.py`: Data loading utilities.
- `data_integrity.py`: Data quality checks and cleaning.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Feature creation and scaling.
- `summary_stats.py`: Statistical summaries and insights.
- `pattern_analysis.py`: Pattern and anomaly detection.
- `outlier_handling.py`: Outlier detection and handling.
- `visualization.py`: Visualization utilities.
- `Iris.csv`: Example dataset (Iris).

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies. Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can also use individual modules for custom analysis or integrate them into your own workflows.

## Notes
- The project is modular and can be extended to other tabular datasets with similar structure.
- Some features (e.g., Kaggle download) require additional setup (e.g., Kaggle API credentials).
